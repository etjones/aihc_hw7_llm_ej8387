Task: Analyze correlations between medications and improved health outcomes for diabetic patients in the Siyeh Synthetic dataset provided in llm_input_data.txt.

Example 1:
Input: Patient with Type 2 Diabetes prescribed Metformin 500mg
- Before medication: HbA1c 8.2%, Fasting glucose 165 mg/dL
- After 6 months: HbA1c 7.1%, Fasting glucose 130 mg/dL
Analysis: This patient showed significant improvement in glycemic control after Metformin initiation, with HbA1c reduction of 1.1% and fasting glucose reduction of 35 mg/dL.

Example 2:
Input: Patient with Type 1 Diabetes prescribed Insulin Glargine
- Before medication: HbA1c 9.3%, Fasting glucose 210 mg/dL
- After 6 months: HbA1c 7.4%, Fasting glucose 140 mg/dL
Analysis: This patient demonstrated substantial improvement with Insulin Glargine, achieving a 1.9% reduction in HbA1c and 70 mg/dL reduction in fasting glucose.

Example 3:
Input: Patient with Type 2 Diabetes prescribed Sitagliptin
- Before medication: HbA1c 7.8%, Fasting glucose 145 mg/dL
- After 6 months: HbA1c 7.6%, Fasting glucose 140 mg/dL
Analysis: This patient showed minimal improvement with Sitagliptin, suggesting it may be less effective for this particular case.

Now, analyze the Siyeh Synthetic dataset in llm_input_data.txt to identify which medications correlate with the best outcomes for diabetic patients. The file contains:
- Medication effectiveness summaries showing mean changes in HbA1c and blood glucose
- Patient examples with detailed medication histories and health outcomes
- Timelines showing health metrics before and after medication administration

Consider factors like:
1. Changes in HbA1c and blood glucose levels as shown in the medication effectiveness summaries
2. Consistency of results across multiple patients
3. Magnitude of improvements in health metrics
4. Time between medication start and observed improvements
5. Patient demographics that might influence outcomes

Provide a comprehensive analysis of medication effectiveness for diabetic patients in this dataset.
